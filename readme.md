Rosreestr Tools are dedicated to
using with xmls (Blocks and Parcels) from rosreestr.ru
and can do the following magic:

1) Check dxf files, containing lines and polylines,
if they are intersecting with XML files from rosreestr.ru
2) Convert XML files to dxf
3) Merge some dxfs in merged one
4) Rename XML files in pretty name

Settings description:
color_iter, colors: colors in dxf file,
if you want one black color - change colors = [7] in settings.json
xml_folder_path - for xml files from rosreestr
dxf_folder_path - for converted dxf files
my_dxf_file_path - for user dxf files needing in check

If your settings.json have errors you can just delete it,
